When run this module simply writes `Hello World` into a LibreOffice Writer Document.

When `hello_world()` macro is called in a LibreOffice Document then `Hello World` is written into that document.

When the `hello_world.py` module is run from code editor it will start LibreOffice,
Create a new Writer Document, and write `Hello World` into it.
After a brief pause the LibreOffice is closed.
